            <h3>Use UMSI-Specific Resources</h3>
            <p>Start with Career Link, which features opportunities specifically seeking UMSI students. Employers posting here are already familiar with your program and skills.</p>
            
            <h3>Network Your Way In</h3>
            <p>Many positions are filled through referrals. Connect with UMSI alumni working at companies you're interested in. Informational interviews can lead to job opportunities.</p>
            
            <h3>Target Companies, Not Just Jobs</h3>
            <p>Identify companies doing work you find interesting, even if they don't have current openings. Follow them, connect with their employees, and apply when positions open.</p>
            
            <h3>Consider Multiple Pathways</h3>
            <p>Look beyond traditional job titles. UMSI skills apply to roles in UX, data science, product management, information security, consulting, and more.</p>
            
            <h3>Apply Early and Often</h3>
            <p>Many companies recruit on academic calendars. Start your search early, especially for summer internships which often have fall deadlines.</p>

            <h2>Job Search FAQ</h2>
            <dl>
                <dt><strong>When should I start my job or internship search?</strong></dt>
                <dd>For summer internships, start in late summer or early fall. For full-time positions after graduation, begin 6-9 months before your target start date. Earlier is always better.</dd>
                
                <dt><strong>How many applications should I submit?</strong></dt>
                <dd>Quality matters more than quantity. It's better to submit 10 well-researched, tailored applications than 50 generic ones. Aim for a steady, consistent pace.</dd>
                
                <dt><strong>What if I don't meet all the qualifications in a job posting?</strong></dt>
                <dd>Job postings often describe an ideal candidate. If you meet 60-70% of the qualifications and are genuinely interested, apply. Highlight how your skills transfer to the requirements you don't fully meet.</dd>
                
                <dt><strong>Should I apply to jobs that don't specifically mention my major?</strong></dt>
                <dd>Absolutely! UMSI students have diverse, transferable skills. Focus on roles that match your skills and interests, not just those that mention your specific degree.</dd>
                
                <dt><strong>How do I stay motivated during a long job search?</strong></dt>
                <dd>Set small, achievable weekly goals. Celebrate small wins. Connect with peers going through the same process. Take breaks when needed. Remember that rejection is normal and doesn't reflect your worth.</dd>
                
                <dt><strong>What should I do while waiting to hear back from employers?</strong></dt>
                <dd>Continue applying to other positions, develop your skills through projects or online courses, network, and prepare for potential interviews. Don't put your search on hold.</dd>
