                <dt><strong>How do I network if I'm introverted?</strong></dt>
                <dd>Networking doesn't have to mean large events. One-on-one coffee chats, informational interviews, and online connections through LinkedIn can be just as effective and may feel more comfortable.</dd>
                
                <dt><strong>What should I say when reaching out to someone I don't know?</strong></dt>
                <dd>Be genuine and specific. Mention how you found them, what interests you about their work, and what you hope to learn. Keep your initial message brief and respectful of their time.</dd>
                
                <dt><strong>How do I follow up after meeting someone?</strong></dt>
                <dd>Send a thank you email within 24-48 hours. Reference something specific from your conversation, express your appreciation, and suggest staying in touch.</dd>
                
                <dt><strong>Is it okay to ask for job referrals?</strong></dt>
                <dd>Build the relationship first. Focus on learning and connecting authentically. Once you've established a genuine connection, it's appropriate to ask for advice about opportunities or if they'd be willing to refer you.</dd>
                
                <dt><strong>How often should I reach out to my network?</strong></dt>
                <dd>Stay in touch periodically by sharing relevant articles, congratulating people on achievements, or checking in a few times a year. Quality matters more than quantity.</dd>
